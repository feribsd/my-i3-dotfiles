The packages for it to work properly are:
```bash
sudo pacman -S firefox feh picom  rofi thunar
```
if you want the script to work just run that command for arch other distros may have other package manager such as apt, apk,
dnf etc.

to change the theme just run the theme switcher script and it will open up rofi giving you the choice to pick your theme


keep in mind these are shitty themes made by me for me so idc what you think about it


also i stole the rofi themes from: https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection
