Required Packages

Install the needed tools on Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S firefox feh picom rofi thunar kitty polybar
```


Other distros will need to install the same packages with their own package manager (apt, dnf, apk).

How to Use

Run the script.sh. It will open a Rofi menu where you can choose the theme you want to apply.

Notes

These themes were made for personal use. They’re not polished, they’re not meant to impress. Use them only if you think Iam so cool and wanna try my things out.

The included Rofi themes were taken from:
